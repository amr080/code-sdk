# @code-wallet/views
This package provides iframes of each of the SDK elements. We use iframes to
isolate the SDK elements from the websites they are embedded into. This
client-side package, it is not meant to be used directly. The elements in this
package are available through the `@code-wallet/elements` package.

Learn more about Code at https://getcode.com. See the
[docs](https://code-wallet.github.io/code-sdk/docs) for more information.
