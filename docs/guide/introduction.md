# Introduction

The Code SDK makes it simple to accept payments on your website or web app. It is open and permissionless, so you can get started with no sign up and just a few lines of code. 

We built the Code SDK after more than a decade of building developer platforms and finding that all existing payment platforms are incredibly limiting where as a developer you get limited global functionality (ie. large, one way payments), you have to build more innovative experiences region by region, and you pay relatively high fees. This constrains the experiences you can build, and the people you can build for. 

The Code SDK provides a set of tools that allows you to embed a "Pay with Code" button in your web experience and charge users as little as 5 cents, unlocking new and exciting experiences not previously possible with other payment platforms. The only cost as a developer is a flat 1 cent fee collected from every payment to cover blockchain transaction costs. 

##  What is the Code SDK?

The Code SDK is a set of JavaScript packages that allow you to integrate Code into your website or web app. The SDK is available as a set of JavaScript packages on npm, and can be used in both the browser and on the server.

See the [docs](https://code-wallet.github.io/code-sdk/docs/guide/introduction) for more information.


##  What is Code?

[Code](https://getcode.com) is the mobile wallet app that users make payments with.

The Code experience is both simple and elegant, where users get all the benefits of self custodial crypto (open, global, secure), without any of the complexity of managing private keys, gas fees, and slow or failed transactions. Code is built on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain, and uses the [Code Sequencer](https://code-wallet.github.io/code-sdk/docs/reference/sequencer.html) to deliver a payments experience that is instant, global, and private.
